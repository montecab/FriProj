/// <summary>
/// piBotModel
/// The classes in this folder are used to represent a physical model of a PlayI Robot.
/// These classes are pure C#, without any unity-specific inclusions (with the exception of logging).
/// 
/// This code serves two distinct use-cases:
/// * The standard "controller" situation,
///   in which case the classes here are acting as a proxy for a physical robot connected to the app.
///   In this case, you send commands to the piBot model and read back sensors.
/// * The simulated robot case,
///   where the classes are a simulated robot, and another controller app is connected.
///   In this case, the piBot receives commands, and provides sensors. (sensors not yet implemented)
///
/// A piBot is fundamentally a collection of piBotComponents.
/// Components are either effectors (wheels, lights, etc) or sensors (distance, accelerometer),
/// or both (eg, wheels contain both a velocity effector and a distance encoder sensor).
///
/// Simulated bots should be "ticked" periodically by calling tick() with the elapsed time.
/// The bot in turn ticks all its relevant components.
/// 
/// Robot class hierarchy:
/// * piBotBase is an abstract class providing connection routines and component framework, but no actual components.
///   * piBotCommon adds in components common to both Bo and Yanna.
///     * piBotAxled adds in wheels. (note, Bo is the only axled robot currently)
///       * piBotBo adds a couple other components in Bo.
///     * piBotYanna adds in a couple Yanna-specific components.
